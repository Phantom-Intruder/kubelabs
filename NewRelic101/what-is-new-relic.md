# New Relic

**New Relic** is an **observability platform** that helps developers, devops, and non-technical management monitor and optimize the performance of their applications and infrastructure. It can give you application level insights by tracking performance metrics for applications (e.g., response time, throughput, error rates) and supports multiple languages like Java, Python, Node.js, .NET, Ruby, PHP, and Go. This is useful for developers and SRE teams that want to quickly get to the root cause of an issue from the applications side. It also provides visibility into servers, containers, cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, GCP), and Kubernetes environments - which is what we will be focusing on. It also provides customizable dashboards for visualizing metrics and logs and helps trace requests as they travel through various services and systems, useful for microservices architectures.

5. **Logs in Context**

   * Collects logs and correlates them with traces and metrics for faster debugging.

6. **Synthetics Monitoring**

   * Simulates user interactions to monitor website availability and performance from different locations globally.

7. **Alerts and AI-Powered Incident Response**

   * Sends alerts based on thresholds or anomalies; uses AI to reduce noise and prioritize incidents.

8. **Browser and Mobile Monitoring**

   * Tracks user experience metrics on web browsers and mobile apps.

### Use Cases:

* Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in code.
* Monitoring cloud infrastructure health.
* Ensuring uptime and availability of websites or APIs.
* Correlating metrics, traces, and logs for faster root cause analysis.

### Pricing:

New Relic uses a usage-based pricing model, which includes:

* Free tier with limited data retention and capabilities.
* Paid plans based on the number of users and amount of data ingested (measured in GBs).

### Competitors:

* Datadog
* Dynatrace
* Splunk Observability
* AppDynamics (Cisco)
