# Upgrading Karpenter

Keeping Karpenter up to date is pretty helpful since a whole bunch of new features gets added in with every major release. Additionally, Karpenter is the tool used to decide which machines your applications would run on, so any cost-efficiency improvements that get added in with every release would help reduce infrastructure expenses. Finally, if you are on a managed Kubernetes service such as AWS EKS, you are required to update the version of EKS to the latest supported version once every 3 months. Older versions of Karpenter can end up getting unsupported during such an upgrade, so it's best to keep the two in sync.

So to start, the first thing you should do is look at the [compatibilty matrix](https://karpenter.sh/v1.0/upgrading/compatibility/). Once you have confirmed that your cluster version and the new version of Karpenter are compatible, let's look at upgrading.
